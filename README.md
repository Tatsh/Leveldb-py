# LevelDB GUI Viewer and Dumper

This repository contains executables (source code coming soon) to view LevelDB's in a GUI or to dump them to a sqlite database and CSV file.

# Special Note:
To use the either program make sure you make a copy of the levelDB directory that you want to view/dump Once you view it and dump it the programs will no longer
be able to read from them so you will have to get a cew copy of them.
